# Demo Project

_(Not a real project. Just a demo project to show how group projects work)_

We're going to build a super simple calculator function (`calculate`). The calculator should receive two numbers and the operation to perform and it should return the result. Example:

```python
calculate(2, 3, 'add')  # Returns 5
calculate(3, 3, 'multiply')  # Returns 9
```

If the calculator receives a parameter with the wrong time, it should return a custom `CalculatorException`.
